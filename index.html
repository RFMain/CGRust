With three teams vying for a prize pool of $150 awarded based on individual kills, this tournament promises to deliver a weekend of intense, high-stakes action. Further details, including registration information, are available on our Discord and in the official registration document. We look forward to seeing our community come together for this exciting inaugural event. </p>
